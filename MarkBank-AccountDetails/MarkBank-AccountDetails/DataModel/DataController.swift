/**
 The Core Data stack is a collection of framework objects that are accessed as part of the initialization of Core Data and that mediate between the objects in your application and external data stores. The Core Data stack handles all of the interactions with the external data stores so that your application can focus on its business logic. The stack consists of four primary objects: the managed object context (NSManagedObjectContext), the persistent store coordinator (NSPersistentStoreCoordinator), the managed object model (NSManagedObjectModel), and the persistent container (NSPersistentContainer).

 You initialize the Core Data stack prior to accessing your application data. The initialization of the stack prepares Core Data for data requests and the creation of data. Hereâ€™s an example of how to create that Core Data stack.

import Foundation
import CoreData

class DataController:ObservableObject{
    //MARK: the NSPersistentContainer handles the creation of the Core Data stack and offers access to the NSManagedObjectContext as well as a number of convenience methods

    let container = NSPersistentContainer(name: "AccountModel")
    
    init(){
        container.loadPersistentStores{ desc, error in
            if let error = error {
                print("Failed to load the data \(error.localizedDescription)")
            }
            
        }
    } // end of init
    
    //MARK: save data
    // The managed object context (NSManagedObjectContext) is the object that your application will interact with the most, and therefore it is the one that is exposed to the rest of your application. Think of the managed object context as an intelligent scratch pad.

    // MARK: The creation of NSManagedObject instances does not guarantee their persistence. After you create an NSManagedObject instance in your managed object context, explicitly save that context to persist those changes to your persistent store.
    
    func save(context:NSManagedObjectContext){
        do{
            try context.save()
            print("Data saved")
        } catch{
            print("Couldn't save the data")
        }
    } // end of save()
    
    func addContact(image: String, name: String, phone: String, context: NSManagedObjectContext){
        
        let contact = People(context: context)
        contact.id = UUID()
        contact.name = name
        contact.phone = phone
        contact.image = image
        
        save(context: context)
    }// end of addContact
    
    //MARK: use shift + command/win + k to clean the cache if you are not able to see the entity
    
    func editContact(contact: People, image: String, name: String, phone: String, context:NSManagedObjectContext){
        contact.phone = phone
        contact.image = image
        contact.name = name
        
        save(context: context)
    }
